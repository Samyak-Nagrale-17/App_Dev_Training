About P-TAL

P-TAL aims at reviving the dying craft form of the indigenous Thathera community of Jandiala Guru, Amritsar, who have the distinction of practising Indiaâ€™s only UNESCO listed craftform. The Thatheras of Jandiala Guru are a community of skilled craftsmen who specialize in the traditional technique of hammering brass and copper sheets into traditional utensils. This crafts colony of Jandiala Guru was established during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1883), the great 19th century Sikh Monarch, who encouraged skilled crafters from Kashmir to settle in the heart of his kingdom in Punjab. P-TAL aims at reviving the languishing craft of Thatheras all across India through a three faceted approach: institutionalisation of artisans, design development and training, and market access through modern techniques. Just like the Thatheras, P-TAL is an epitome of transforming tradition into trend while converting practice into perfection thus moulding the vessels of hope!
